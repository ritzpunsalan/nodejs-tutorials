Debugging Node.js Applications

timer: 6:40

type in node.js cmd:

    node playground/debugging.js                                ((playground/) is a folder and (debugging) is the file. when combined with a / , the file can be activated in node.) 
    node inspect playground/debugging.js                        (inspect is the active debug cmd.)
    
    debug> list(10)                                             (list the number of lines)
    n                                                           (very next statement)
    c                                                           (to continue)
    ^c                                                          (ctrl + c twice shuts down debugger)
    repl                                                        (read-eval-print-loop. quick and easy way to test simple node.js)
    person.age                                                  (under person. dot only gets the second in line. which is age)
    person.age + 100                                            (adds a 100 to age number.)
    person.age = 100                                            (age will equal to 100.)
    clear                                                       (wipes the page off. clean and clear.)
    node inspect 20applec20.js read --title="to buy"
    nodemon inspect 20applec20.js read --title="to buy"
